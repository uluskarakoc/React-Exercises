# 3. [Create a React state variable to hold API data](https://dev.to/olenadrugalya/ways-of-getting-data-from-api-in-react-2kpf)

Before you start

- Navigate to the directory `task-03` in your terminal
- Install dependencies with `npm install`

## Instructions

Make an API request to a third party open API, which requires no authentication.

Use the [Game of Thrones "API of Fire and Ice"](https://anapioficeandfire.com/)  to fetch and display all Game of Thrones books and individual details of each book. Use this endpoint: https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/books.

Store data from the API with [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html).

Get the data using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch).

The requirements are:

- Create a React state variable to hold data
- Make the API request and store the data
- Render the returned data
